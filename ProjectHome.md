# Abstract #
Suite of tools to generate, plan, observe, reduce and publish data related to CCD Images of asteroids taken under less than optimum conditions for astrometric positions of asteroids using Linux, PyRAF, and other tools.

# Summary #
This project is the result of a request by a  local high school intern program to for a locak 501(c)3 astronomy club to expose interns to career details of astronomy. The club was exploring using a pick-off port camera to acquire images of asteroids for comparison to noise statistics for similar images from a meter-class pipeline. This project contains the basic tools we used to expedite planning for targets of opportunity.
